# Coomunity-forum
## A community discussion forum using node.js

## It is a community discussion forum made in express.js and mongodb
## Here the user can create a account, login, discuss on common community topics, ask questions, answer questions, get badges etc.
## The original idea was from [Qbonanza.com](https://github.com/KartikeyKakaria/Qbonanza.com)

## The modules used in it are:-
```sh
 npm i express
 npm i mongoose
 npm i hbs
 npm i bcryptjs
 npm i jsonwebtoken
 npm i cookie-parser
```
## You can create a .env file as well to store private data like database path, jwt password and server port. For that, install the following package
```sh
 npm i dotenv
```

### Note: The template for user registration and login was taken from [registration](https://github.com/KartikeyKakaria/registration)
